# RTTT
A recursive and random tick tac toe board game (for led coffee-table)

# Game Description
The game consists of 9 tick tac toe games with randomly generated suggestions. Each player picks the best suggestion before their 3 seconds is up and then the next player gets to choose. If a player wins a board, the board matches thier color, the player wins the game by winning 3 boards in a row on the table, as though each board was a nought or cross for the game.

# Hardware
This will run on my GHP tech challenge project. This is a replacement firmware for dvtate/maze-game .
